**Employee Churn Analysis**
**Project Overview**
This project aims to predict employee churn using logistic regression. The dataset used for this analysis is included in the repository.
The project follows a structured approach to building an employee churn prediction model. 
The stages include:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the dataset's structure, distribution of features, and identifying patterns.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing any inconsistencies in the data.
Data Transformation: Transforming categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and preparing the data for modeling.
Model Building and Evaluation: Developing a logistic regression model to predict employee churn and evaluating its performance using appropriate metrics.

**Dataset**
The dataset provided contains information about employees, job-related attributes, and churn status.

**Power BI Dashboard**
A Power BI dashboard will be added shortly to provide interactive visualizations and insights into the data.

**Tree-Based Analysis**
Additionally, a tree-based analysis will be performed and added shortly to the repository to explore feature importance and gain further insights into factors influencing employee churn.

**How to Use**
To replicate the analysis or explore the code:
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook files to view the code and follow along with the analysis.
3. Run the notebooks in your preferred environment to reproduce the results.

**Contributions**
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to suggest improvements, report issues, or add enhancements to the project.
